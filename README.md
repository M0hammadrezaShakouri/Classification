# Classification
Implementing neural network (multi class)classification python from scratch

In this project :
I used one normal datasets which include information about height, weight and sex of some random people.

The 2nd one is a Glass Identification dataset from UCI which contains 10 attributes including id. The response is glass type (discrete 7 values). The last column contains label of the glass.

I have done the following takes in this project:

  1. divide the data into two categories: training data (70%) and test data (30%).
  2. create the network 
  3. For test data, report all classification performance metrics.
